# ImGui-KeyAuth-Example
- A base/example for a KeyAuth loader, built in C++, using ImGUI DX9 WIN32
- You **MUST** import ImGUI * DirectXTeX yourself, it is **NOT** included with the project **AND** is needed for the project to be fully compilable, but the project **IS** setup for a simple drag and drop of both
